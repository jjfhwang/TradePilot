# TradePilot

## Description

TradePilot is an automated cryptocurrency trading bot designed to leverage algorithmic execution for optimized trading strategies. By interfacing directly with cryptocurrency exchange APIs, TradePilot aims to automate the process of buying and selling cryptocurrencies based on predefined rules and market conditions. This reduces the need for constant manual monitoring and allows for the efficient execution of complex trading strategies. The bot provides a framework for implementing diverse trading approaches, from simple moving average crossovers to sophisticated machine learning models. It is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to customize the bot to suit their individual trading needs and risk tolerance.

## Features

*   **Automated Trading:** Executes buy and sell orders automatically based on pre-defined trading rules and market data.
*   **API Integration:** Supports seamless integration with various cryptocurrency exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken).
*   **Customizable Strategies:** Allows users to define and implement custom trading strategies using Python code.
*   **Backtesting Capabilities:** Includes tools for backtesting trading strategies against historical data to evaluate performance.
*   **Risk Management:** Implements risk management features such as stop-loss orders and position sizing.

## Installation

    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/TradePilot.git`
    `cd TradePilot`

2.  **Install Python 3.7 or higher:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.7 or a later version installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    `python3 -m venv venv`

4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    *   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

5.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following dependencies:

    

    Note: You may need to install TA-Lib separately. Refer to the TA-Lib installation instructions for your operating system: [https://mrjbq7.github.io/TA-Lib/install.html](https://mrjbq7.github.io/TA-Lib/install.html)

6.  **Configure your API keys:**

    Obtain API keys from your chosen cryptocurrency exchange and configure them in the `config.py` file.  A sample `config.py` might look like this:

    

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use TradePilot:

1.  **Initialize the Exchange Connection:**

    

2.  **Implement a Simple Trading Strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover):**

    

3.  **Backtesting:**

    

    **Note:** These are simplified examples. You will need to adapt the code to your specific needs and risk management preferences. Ensure you understand the risks involved in automated trading before deploying the bot with real funds. The exchange connector (`trade_pilot.exchange.ExchangeConnector`), backtester (`trade_pilot.backtesting.Backtester`) and sample strategy (`trade_pilot.strategies.SimpleMovingAverageCrossover`) are assumed to exist in the project structure. You would need to implement these modules based on your specific requirements.
